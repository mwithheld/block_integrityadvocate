# IntegrityAdvocate Moodle block

Integrity Advocate does identity verification & participation monitoring.

This block can be added to Moodle activities and makes the IntegrityAdvocate proctoring interface show up for students, and shows instructors an overview button so they can view IA results.

Requirements, installation, setup, etc can be found in the [Integrity Advocate Moodle plugins wiki](https://bitbucket.org/mwebv/moodle-block_integrityadvocate/wiki/)
